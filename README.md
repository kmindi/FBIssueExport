## Synopsis

This eclipse plugin extends the FindBugs eclipse plugin. 
It adds an export feature to export found bugs to popular social coding platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket.

## Example Screenshots

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Many developers can't decide on their own if static analysis bugs are relevant and how to fix them correctly. This is caused by non-intuitive bug descriptions and possible false positives.
This plugin trys to provide better interaction through exporting the found bug to the discussion platform used by the project.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Dependencies

- FindBugs
- JGit

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors
